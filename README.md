# Python-Platformer
This is a repository for a Python-based platformer game using Pygame. 

This is essentially a dupe of [Python Platformer Game Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gLeplbqtqg) by freeCodeCamp.org.
My goal is to flesh this out into a game with multiple different traps, levels, and added mechanics.
